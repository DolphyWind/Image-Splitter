# Image Splitter
Image splitter for sprite animations.

Let's say we have bunch of sprite in a single sprite like this:

We've to split them equally to make animation.
This python script does that.

Here's example outputs:

![Circle 0](https://i.ibb.co/N1DgZZk/Circle-0.png)![Circle 1](https://i.ibb.co/gT19BVs/Circle-1.png)![Circle 2](https://i.ibb.co/Qv88yRz/Circle-2.png)![Circle 3](https://i.ibb.co/CKnLCXL/Circle-3.png)![Circle 4](https://i.ibb.co/LN6Pmt6/Circle-4.png)![Circle 5](https://i.ibb.co/9NW8q62/Circle-5.png)![Circle 6](https://i.ibb.co/MsJxCR4/Circle-6.png)![Circle 7](https://i.ibb.co/nfWVSHL/Circle-7.png)
